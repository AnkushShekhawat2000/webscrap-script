She was overly concerned with a blood blister on the bottom of my foot (I walk/run barefoot a lot)--insisting that she take pictures of it. Seems like a typical book-smart doctor that has never had a blood blister before. Come on. Even I know that's irrelevant. Summary: We need better doctors who are willing to collaborate with their patients, find root causes rather than treating symptoms, and who have contact with reality/experience in the real world so that they know what is worth paying attention to.""
""I went in to get a skin check for cancer, see about getting some moles/skin tags removed, and if there was anything that could be done about some rashy skin. She was very short with me and didn't answer my questions. She seemed more concerned with a bump on my forehead I thought was just a zit. She never told me it with it was. Frankly I wouldn't go back if it wasn't for I'd have to start over with another dermatologist."""

Thankfully all I did was head home. I thought I could feel dampness on my pant leg. When we got out at Smyrna I decided to check. Blood was running down my leg and soaking into my pants. Thankfully I did not have other activities planned after the visit. I called your office and never received a call back. In Smyrna I replaced bandaid with two bandaids. Which soaked through immediately. I kept pressure on it on my way to Houlton ER. The bleeding was almost stopped by the time I was seen. They put a pressure bandage on it. Thankfully I knew to put pressure on it as I was driving. I also tried calling this morning and left messages since you can’t get through to a human and have not yet received a call back.

After leaving several messages with his Referral Coordinator, I finally got a call back. The young lady I spoke to was unpleasant, to say the least. She let me know that they had a very busy practice and had not gotten to my referral yet (over two weeks since the referral). I told her that I had a growth on my arm that was getting bigger, and bigger. It was a basically \"we don't care\" attitude. I realize that I am nobody Special, but her attitude was something I will not tolerate. I called back today and let her know I no longer wanted to deal with their practice. What a horrible experience!\"",

She took her time to address each of my concerns and made sure I understood what I needed to do. I left with respect and appreciation for Dr Iyer.\"",

But she ignored my questions and did not engage in conversation with me. She clearly saw me as a checkbox and not a human. 2. She just prescribed medication for symptoms without discussing root cause. 3. She was overly concerned with a blood blister on the bottom of my foot (I walk/run barefoot a lot)--insisting that she take pictures of it. Seems like a typical book-smart doctor that has never had a blood blister before. Come on. Even I know that's irrelevant. Summary: We need better doctors who are willing to collaborate with their patients, find root causes rather than treating symptoms, and who have contact with reality/experience in the real world so that they know what is worth paying attention to.\"",
